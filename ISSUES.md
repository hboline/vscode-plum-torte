# Issues

## v0.0.3

## v0.0.2
- Active tabs sometimes have the wrong foreground color (it's bright pink instead of whiteFFFFFF)
    - I think this has to do with however text is colored/highlighted on the sidebar. I need to look into what these colors mean
- Terminal highlight color is too dim. Either that, or the foreground of the highlighted text is too bright
- Activity bar (lefthand bar) inactive forground color is a bit too bright
- Text cursor is hard to discern when next to parantheses highlighting
