# Current Issues

## v0.0.2
- Active tabs sometimes have the wrong foreground color (it's bright pink instead of whiteFFFFFF)
- Terminal highlight color is too dim. Either that, or the foreground of the highlighted text is too bright
- Activity bar (lefthand bar) inactive forground color is a bit too bright.
